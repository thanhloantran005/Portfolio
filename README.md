| Project | Area of Analysis | Project Description |
|---|---|---|
| [Digital Marketing Sales Analysis](https://github.com/thanhloantran005/SQL-Case-Studies/blob/main/Digital%20Marketing%20Sales%20Analysis.md) | Marketing & Sales | I answer business questions on **campaign ROI & channel mix**, **funnel conversion & AOV**, **creative/hook effectiveness**, **geo/device segmentation**, and **day/date seasonality** to guide budget and strategy. |
| [Multilingual App Mini Case Study](https://github.com/thanhloantran005/SQL-Case-Studies/blob/main/Multilingual%20App%20Mini%20Case%20Study.md) | App Ratings | I analyzed ratings and reviews by **app/category**, **age cohort**, **country**, and **device type** to surface top/bottom performers and the most-helpful reviews. |

## Data Visualization

| Project | Project Description | Dashboard |
|---|---|---|
| **Clean Seas Florida Keys — Impact Dashboard** | Analyzed 2019–2023 dive logs & debris tallies; standardized units; built a Tableau dashboard with shop-level filters and KPIs (divers, trips/hours, area cleaned, debris mix, derelict traps, total pounds). | [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/thanhloan.tran/viz/CourtneysDashboard2/Dashboard1) |
| **Gifting Campaign Performance (TikTok/Instagram)** | Consolidated creator posts and built a Looker Studio report with **campaign totals/averages**, **uploads trend**, **top views/engagements**, and **content-style effectiveness** (hook & talking style, platform mix) with creator attribute filters. | [Screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57b78508-2405-4f03-9d0d-0ccb32e08716) |

## Strategy

| Project | Project Description | Links |
|---|---|---|
| **Social Media Campaign Analysis** | Compared **campaign ER vs. creators’ historical ER** (50% within ±1% benchmark). Assessed **talking vs. non-talking** performance (talking drove higher avg views). Themed comments (ingredients, routines, targeted concerns). Highlighted **saves & shares** as strong interest signals. | [ER Analysis](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2e2dca6-3e42-493d-8086-383da090089a) · [Talking Style](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e08e78d-6efe-4737-8868-751e06e0af51) · [Comment Themes](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e08e78d-6efe-4737-8868-751e06e0af51) |
| **Digital Campaign Measurement** | Broke the campaign into **four steps** with a simple checklist of **key questions + channels** per stage. This keeps reporting consistent and helps teams troubleshoot from **awareness → intent**. | [Slide](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1afd3f6d-4c85-4d2d-a033-d461d00f7c20) |
