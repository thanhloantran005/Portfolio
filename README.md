# Data visualization

| Project | Project Description | Dashboard Link |
|---|---|---|
| [Ocean Cleanup Analysis]| I analyzed 2019‚Äì2023 dive logs and debris tallies, cleaning and standardizing units into a single dataset. I built a Tableau dashboard with shop-level filters that surfaces KPIs (divers, trips/hours, area cleaned, debris mix, traps, pounds) for year-over-year reporting.| [Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/thanhloan.tran/viz/CourtneysDashboard2/Dashboard1) |
| [Gifted Campaign Dashboard](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Covid-19-and-Impact-on-Malaysia-stock-market) | A project close to üè° home. Inspired by Alex Freberg's [Data Exploration Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8H48Pj32z4GZgGWyylqv85f&index=1), I analyzed TikTok/Instagram performance for a gifting campaign and built a Looker Studio dashboard tracking views, engagements, and ER% over time. I modeled creator- and content-level cuts (top videos/creators, hook & talking style, platform mix) and added filters for niche, ethnicity, and follower range to guide creative and budget decisions. | [Dashboard](![IMG_1780](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57b78508-2405-4f03-9d0d-0ccb32e08716)|

# Strategy

| Project | Project Description | Analysis Link |
|---|---|---|
| [Social Media Campaign Analysis] | I analyzed creators‚Äô engagement by comparing campaign ER to their historical averages and found that 50% stayed within a 1% benchmark. I evaluated the performance of talking vs. non-talking videos, discovering that talking videos generated significantly higher average views and revealed differences in how influencers build trust. I synthesized audience comments into themes like ingredients, routine integration, and targeted concerns, and highlighted saves and shares as strong signals of product interest. | [Engagement Rate Analysis](<img width="1263" height="643" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2e2dca6-3e42-493d-8086-383da090089a" />) [Talking Style Analysis](<img width="1269" height="643" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e08e78d-6efe-4737-8868-751e06e0af51" />) [Comment Analysis](<img width="1269" height="643" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e08e78d-6efe-4737-8868-751e06e0af51" />) 
 |
| [Digital Campaign Measurement](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Covid-19-and-Impact-on-Malaysia-stock-market) |I broke the campaign into four steps and listed the key question and channels for each. This keeps reporting consistent and helps us find and fix problems one step at a time, from awareness to intent.| [Project Slide] <img width="1255" height="703" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1afd3f6d-4c85-4d2d-a033-d461d00f7c20" />
