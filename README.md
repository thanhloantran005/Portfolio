## SQL

| Project Link | Area of Analysis | Project Description |
|---|---|---|
| [Digital Marketing Sales Analysis](https://github.com/thanhloantran005/SQL-Case-Studies/blob/main/Digital%20Marketing%20Sales%20Analysis.md) | Marketing & Sales | I answer business questions on **campaign ROI & channel mix**, **funnel conversion & AOV**, **creative/hook effectiveness**, **geo/device segmentation**, and **day/date seasonality** to guide budget and strategy. |
| [Multilingual App Mini Case Study](https://github.com/thanhloantran005/SQL-Case-Studies/blob/main/Multilingual%20App%20Mini%20Case%20Study.md) | App Ratings | I analyzed ratings and reviews by **app/category**, **age cohort**, **country**, and **device type** to find top/bottom performers and the most-helpful reviews. |

## Data Visualization

| Project Title | Project Description | Dashboard |
|---|---|---|
| **Clean Seas Florida Keys: Impact Dashboard** | I analyzed 2019â€“2023 dive logs & debris tallies, standardized units, and built a Tableau dashboard with dive shop filters showcasing key KPIs (divers, trips/hours, area cleaned, debris mix, derelict traps, total pounds). | [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/thanhloan.tran/viz/CourtneysDashboard2/Dashboard1) |
| **Gifting Campaign Performance (TikTok/Instagram)** | This is a snapshot of a dashboard deliverable for top Korean brand clients. (Note: some parts are blurred for confidentiality) I consolidated creator posts and built a Looker Studio report with **campaign totals/averages**, **uploads trend**, **top views/engagements**, and **content-style effectiveness** (hook & talking style, product mix) with creator attribute filters. | [Screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57b78508-2405-4f03-9d0d-0ccb32e08716) |

## Strategy

| Project Title | Project Description | Links |
|---|---|---|
| **Social Media Campaign Analysis** | This is a snapshot of a reporting deck deliverable for top Korean brand clients. (Note: some parts are blurred for confidentiality) The goal was to understand why the campaign underperformed. Here, I compared **campaign ER vs. creatorsâ€™ historical ER** (50% within Â±1% benchmark). I also assessed **talking vs. non-talking** performance (talking drove higher avg views). Finally, I performed qualitative comment analysis (ingredients, routines, targeted concerns), highlighting **saves & shares** as strong interest signals.| [ER Analysis](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2e2dca6-3e42-493d-8086-383da090089a) Â· [Talking Style](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e08e78d-6efe-4737-8868-751e06e0af51) Â· [Comment Themes](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea3fe7b8-5c30-4a9b-bbc2-4f3266c921ad)|
| **Digital Campaign Measurement** | This is a snapshot of a measurement plan deliverable for an unbranded campaign. (Note: some parts are blurred for confidentiality) I broke the campaign into **four steps** with a simple checklist of **key questions + channels** per stage. This keeps reporting consistent and helps teams troubleshoot from **awareness â†’ intent**. | [Slide](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1afd3f6d-4c85-4d2d-a033-d461d00f7c20) |
